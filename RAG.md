# RAG

- is a technique to improve user prompts.

eg: (Small Idea)
1. Multi shot prompting
2. Use of tools (like query DB)
3. Additional context


Taking this to next level:

1. Build a database/knowledgebase
2. every time  user ask a question, look up the knowledge base and send the enhanced context to the prompt LLM.

# Task is to build AI RAG Knowledge Worker for a company. 

The blunt instrument implementation:

- read names of employees, look up the files in drive and enahance the prompt.
